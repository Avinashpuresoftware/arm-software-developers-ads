## Introduction

There are many versions of the [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) toolchain available for use. In general, the latest version is recommended for use, as this will contain the latest optimization improvements, as well as support for the latest Arm IP. However there are reasons you may wish to use earlier compiler versions, especially where Functional Safety is concerned, where a specific compiler version is often mandated. A special branch of Arm Compiler for Embedded, known as [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa), is available for this use case.

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are license managed.
