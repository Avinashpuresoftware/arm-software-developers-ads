[Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) is a mature toolchain tailored to the development of bare-metal software, firmware, and Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) applications for Arm.

A safety qualified branch of Arm Compiler for Embedded, known as [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa), is available for safety critical applications.

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are [license managed](../license/).

## Use compiler supplied with Arm Development Studio / Keil MDK

The easiest way to access the Arm Compiler for Embedded is to use the version provided with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio). A given Development Studio version will contain the latest compiler version available at the time of release, and is generally up to date.

Cortex-M users can also use the compiler as provided with [Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5).

Note that Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa is not _installed_ as part of Arm Development Studio or Keil MDK, and must be downloaded seperately.

## Download standalone compiler packages {#download}

Individual compiler packages for all supported host platforms can be downloaded from the Product Downloads section of the Arm website.

[What should I do if I want to download a legacy release of Arm Compiler?](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005184)

These can either be used standalone or integrated into your Arm Development Studio installation. For the latter, you must first [register](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain) your new compiler installation with Development Studio, before then [configuring](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain/Configure-a-compiler-toolchain-for-the-Arm-DS-command-prompt) the environment to use that version.

To install on Windows, unzip the downloaded package, launch the installer, and follow on-screen prompts.
```console
win-x86_64\setup.exe
```
To automate installation of a standalone compiler package on Linux which has been downloaded in the current directory:

{{< tabpane code=true >}}
  {{< tab header="x86_64" >}}
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./install_x86_64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="aarch64" >}}
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz
./install_aarch64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

Remove the install data when complete.

```console
cd ..
rm -r tmp
```
Add the `bin` directory of the installation to the `PATH` and confirm `armclang` can be invoked.

{{< tabpane code=true >}}
  {{< tab header="bash" >}}
export PATH=/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18/bin:$PATH
{{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab header="csh/tcsh" >}}
set path=(/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18/bin $path)
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

Further installation instructions are given in the [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Installing-Arm-Compiler-for-Embedded).

## Setting up product license

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are license managed. License setup instructions are available [here](../license/).

## Get started

Check that the correct compiler version is being used:
```console
armclang --version
```
To verify everything is working, build a simple `Hello World` example as described [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Compiling-a-Hello-World-example).
```C
// Hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```
```console
armclang --target=aarch64-arm-none-eabi hello.c
```
