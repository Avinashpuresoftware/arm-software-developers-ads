[Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) is the most comprehensive embedded C/C++ dedicated software development solution. It is used for validation of SoC debug through emulation, simulation, FPGA, and silicon bring-up design and verification stages. It has the earliest support for all Arm CPUs and interconnects.

## Prerequisites

Arm Development Studio can be installed on Windows and Linux hosts.

Full host platform requirements are given in the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/2022-0/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Hardware-and-host-platform-requirements).

## Download installer packages

The installer will depend on the [edition](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio#Editions) of Development Studio that you are entitled to. 

Gold, Silver, and Bronze editions are one installer, with available features defined by the license. The version is denoted by `year.index`, where `index` is a number (for example `2022.2`).

Development Studio Platinum Edition has its own installation package. The version is denoted by `year.index`, where `index` is a letter (for example `2022.c`).

You can download the Development Studio installer from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads). For more information on the Download Hub, see [here](../pdh).
