[Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Fixed%20Virtual%20Platforms) are complete simulations of an Arm system, including processor, memory and peripherals. These are set out in a "programmer's view", which gives you a comprehensive model on which to build and test your software.

FVPs are provided as a library of ready to use systems. An appropriate subset of the library is provided with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) and [Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5) Professional Edition. All such FVPs are license managed.

Furthermore Arm provides a collection of free-of-charge [Ecosystem FVPs](../ecosystem_fvp) for certain use cases.

## Download installer packages

You can download the FVP library installer from the [Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/view/FM000A). Linux (AArch64 and x86) and Windows (x86 only) hosts are supported.

## Setting up product license

Arm FVPs (other than Ecosystem FVPs) are license managed. License setup instructions are available [here](../license/).
