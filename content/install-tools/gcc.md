## GCC {#top}

There are multiple flavors of [GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/), for the Arm architecture. To know which compiler you need consider the variables below. 

- Target environment where you want the compiled software to run: bare metal or real time operating system (RTOS), Linux kernel and applications, Android applications, or Windows applications.

- Host machine, where you will do the compiling: Windows, Linux, or macOS

- Architecture of the host machine: x86 or Arm

This section provides installation instructions for GCC targeting the Arm architecture.

Navigate to the section of interest.

- [GCC as a native compiler on Arm Linux](#native)   
Use this option to install GCC using the Linux package manager and build applications on an Arm Linux system. 

- [GCC as a cross-compiler](#cross)  
Use this option to install GCC using the Linux package manager and build bare metal applications by cross compiling them for the Arm architecture from an x86 or Arm Linux host machine. Also, use this option to install and compile Linux applications from an x86 host for an Arm target. 

- [GCC from the Arm GNU Toolchain](#Arm-GNU)  
Use this option to download an install a version of GCC produced by Arm. It is available from the Arm Developer website and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS host machines. It supports bare-metal and Linux targets. 

# GCC as a native compiler on Arm Linux {#native}

GCC is available on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager.

## Introduction

Follow the instructions below to install GCC on an Arm Linux distribution. This covers gcc and g++ for compiling C and C++ applications.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash { command_line="user@localhost | 2" }
uname -m
aarch64
```

## Download 

The Linux package manager downloads the required files so there are no special instructions.

## Installation

### Installing on Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu

Use the `apt` command to install software packages on any Debian based Linux distribution, including Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc g++ -y
```

Another meta-package on Ubuntu is ``build-essential``. This will install the most common tools libraries with a single command.

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

### Installing on Red Hat / Fedora / Amazon Linux

These Linux distributions use `yum` as the package manager. 

To install the most common development tools use the commands below. If the machine has `sudo` you can use it.

```console
sudo yum update
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
```

If `sudo` is not available become _root_ and omit the `sudo`.

```console
yum update
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
```

## Setting up product license

GCC is open source and freely available for use. 

## Get started {#start}

To confirm the installation is complete run:

```bash
gcc --version
```

To compile an example program, create a text file named hello-world.c with the contents below.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, Arm World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile the hello-world program use:

```bash
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
```

To run the application enter:

```bash { command_line="user@localhost | 2" }
./hello-world
Hello, Arm World!
```

The program will print the string in the printf() statement.

# Install GCC as a cross-compiler {#cross}

GCC is available on all Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager. 

This covers gcc and g++ for compiling C and C++ as a cross-compiler targeting the Arm architecture.

## Introduction

GCC is often used to cross-compile software for Arm microcontrollers and embedded devices which have firmware and other low-level software. The executables are arm-none-eabi-gcc and arm-none-eabi-g++

GCC is also used to cross compile Linux applications. Applications can be compiled for 32-bit or 64-bit Linux systems. 

The executables for 32-bit are arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc and arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++. 

The executables for 64-bit are aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc and aarch64-linux-gnu-g++

Software can be compiled on an x86 or or Arm Linux host machine.

## Download 

The Linux package manager will download the required files so there are no special download instructions.

## Installation

### Installing on Debian based distributions such as Ubuntu

Use the `apt` command to install software packages on any Debian based Linux distribution.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu 
```

### Installing on Red Hat / Fedora / Amazon Linux

These Linux distributions use `yum` as the package manager. 

To install the most common development tools use the commands below. If the machine has `sudo` you can use it or run `yum` as _root_.

```console
sudo yum update
sudo yum -y install arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs
sudo yum -y install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo yum -y install gcc-arm-linux-gnu

```

If `sudo` is not available become _root_ and omit the `sudo`.

```console
yum update
yum install -y arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs
yum -y install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
yum -y install gcc-arm-linux-gnu
```

## Setting up product license {#license}

GCC is open source and freely available for use. 

## Get started {#start}

To confirm the installation is successful, enter:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

To compile an example program, create a text file named hello-world.c with the contents below.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, Arm World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

To compile hello-world as a bare-metal application:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc --specs=rdimon.specs hello-world.c -o hello-world.elf
```

To cross-compile hello-world as a 32-bit Linux application.

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc  hello-world.c -o hello-world.elf
```

To cross-compile hello-world as a 64-bit Linux application.

```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc hello-world.c -o hello-world.elf
```

# Install GCC using the Arm GNU Toolchain {#Arm-GNU}


## Introduction

Arm GNU Toolchain is a community supported pre-built GNU compiler toolchain for Arm based CPUs.
There are many versions of the [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) available for use. In general, the latest version is recommended for use, as this will contain the latest optimization improvements, as well as support for the latest Arm IP. However there are reasons you may wish to use earlier compiler versions, when a specific compiler version is often mandated. 

## Download toolchain

Arm GNU Toolchain releases consists of cross toolchains for the following host operating systems:
    
GNU/Linux    
  * Available for x86_64 and AArch64 host architectures
  * Available for bare-metal and Linux targets      
    
Windows    
  * Available for x86 host architecture only (compatible with x86_64)
  * Available for bare-metal and Linux targets
                      
macOS    
  * Available for x86_64 host architecture only
  * Available for bare-metal targets only
    
Download the correct toolchain variant for your development needs from the [Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/downloads).

## Installation

### Installing executables on Linux

Unpack the tarball to the install directory, and add the `bin` directory to `PATH`
```console
cd ${install_dir} && tar xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-_version_-linux.tar.bz2
export PATH=${install_dir}/bin:$PATH
```
If you want to use `gdb python build` (`arm-none-eabi-gdb-py`), then
install `python2.7`.

For some Ubuntu releases, the toolchain can also be installed via
[Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~team-gcc-arm-embedded/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

### Installing executables on Mac OS X
Unpack the tarball to the install directory
```console
cd ${install_dir} && tar xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-_version_-mac.tar.bz2
```
Add `bin` directory to `$PATH` by editing the `/etc/paths` file with an appropriate editor, for example:
```console
sudo nano /etc/paths
```

### Installing executables on Windows
Double-click on the installer (e.g. `gcc-arm-_version_--mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe`) and follow on-screen instructions.

The installer can also be run on the command line. When run on
the command-line, the following options can be set:
  - `/S` Run in silent mode
  - `/P` Adds the installation `bin` directory to the system `PATH`
  - `/R` Adds Install Folder registry entry for the install.

For example, to install the tools silently, amend users `PATH` and add registry entry:
```console
gcc-arm-_version_--mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe /S /P /R
```

The zip package is a backup to Windows installer for those who cannot run the installer. You can unzip the package and then invoke it following instructions in the next section.

To use `gdb python build` (`arm-none-eabi-gdb-py`), you must install 32 bit
`python2.7` irrespective of 32 or 64 bit Windows. You can get the package from [here](https://www.python.org/download/).


## Setting up product license 

Arm GNU Toolchain is open sourced and freely available for use. No licenses need to be set up for use.

To use the Arm GNU Toolchain in conjunction with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) you must [register the toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/2022-0/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain).

## Get started 

To verify the installation is correct enter:
```console
arm-none-eabi-gcc -v
```

Additional examples are included in the toolchain installation at:
```console
${install_dir}/_version_/share/gcc-arm-none-eabi/samples
```
