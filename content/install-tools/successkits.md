Arm Development tools are packaged as [Arm Success Kits](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/success-kits). These come in two forms:

- Software Success Kits (SSK)
- Hardware Success Kits (HSK)

SSKs contain all of the software development tools provided by Arm.

HSKs include SSK as well as additional tools for IP configuration and evaluation.

Arm Success Kits are a component of [Arm Flexible Access](https://www.arm.com/en/products/flexible-access).

## Downloading Success Kit components

All downloads are provided via the [Arm Product Download Hub](https://developer.arm.com/downloads). You will need to set up an account for this system to be able to download. It may be that only certain contacts within your organization have such access. If you are unsure, please contact your Arm account manager for assistance.

You can download individual components, or the complete success kits. Bundles are provided for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Note that not all components are supported on all hosts.

The Product Download Hub uses [IBM Aspera Connect](https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect/) to enable high-speed download of IP bundles. If prompted, follow on-screen instructions to install Aspera to your browser.

Once downloaded, you can untar the bundles, and install the necessary components.
