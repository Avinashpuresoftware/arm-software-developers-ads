# Prerequisites
#   - Place in a list in the content section, directly below the front-matter. 
#   - Add key links to prereqs such as a link to [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or a [learning path](/learning-paths/cloud/providers).
#   - List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
        # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
        # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
        # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
        # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
