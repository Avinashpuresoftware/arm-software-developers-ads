## 1) No first person
Active voice is prefered. 
    - Great:	 	Implement this process to…
    - OK:   		You can implement this process to…
    - OK:           We can implement this process to…
    - Bad:      	I implemented this process to…

## 2) Get to the point
Use short, crisp sentances. 
    - Due to the fact that we leveraged the CMSIS software library, issues with starting from scratch were avoided, and where you totally lacked the ability to implement optimized software before, you can now do so easily.
    - reframe

## 3) Be specific
Use numbers and examples, not weasel words.
    - "almost always works" --> "works when on Linux and Windows 10 and above."
    - "significantly better performance" --> "30% performance improvement"
