## Title
Should start with a verb (learn, build, etc.), have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

## Description
One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

## minutes to complete
Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

## who is this for
One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

## Learning objectives
2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

## prerequisites
List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
    - Add key links to prereqs such as a link to [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or a [learning path](/learning-paths/cloud/providers).
- An account with the Arm-based cloud service [provider](../providers/) of choice.
