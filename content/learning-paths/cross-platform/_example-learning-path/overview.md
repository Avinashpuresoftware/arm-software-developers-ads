# Why do learning paths exist?
Different content supports different ways of working. 

* [Documentation and reference manuals](https://www.developer.arm.com/docs) act as the golden source of truth for developing for Arm-powered hardware. 

* [Blogs](https://www.community.arm.com) offer news and announcements for recent and upcoming Arm activities.

* **[Learning Paths and videos]**(https://www.arm.com/developer/learn) offer a consice end-to-end tutorial to achieve a specific outcome. These are supported by [tool quick-start guides](https://www.arm.com/developer/learn/tool-install) to go from 0 to 'hello world' for key Arm ecosystem tools.

# What is a learning path?
A learning path is...
- A consice end-to-end tutorial with steps to enable developers to complete a specific task.
- Always technical, relevant, and up-to-date.
- Simple for anyone to create to through a GitHub-based contribution process.

A learning path is NEVER...
- Documentation, downloads, or the golden source of truth for a product.
- A marketing device or short-lived content/news

# Where do learning paths live?
[GitHub](https://github.com/zachlas/arm-software-developers-ads). The content is written in markdown and is rendered into a website via Hugo.

# Who can write a learning path?
Anyone, yourself included!

# How can I write a learning path?
Follow the steps in this Learning Path.

# When will a learning path be reviewed and published?
The contribution process can be broken down into these four flows, as described through the rest of this learning path:
1. Machine Initalization
2. Contribute
3. Publish
4. Update
