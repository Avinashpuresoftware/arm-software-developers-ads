## Why do learning paths exist?
Different content supports different ways of working. 

[Documentation and reference manuals](https://www.developer.arm.com/docs) act as the golden source of truth for developing for Arm-powered hardware. 

[Blogs](https://www.community.arm.com) offer news and announcements for recent and upcoming Arm activities.

**[Learning Paths and videos]**(https://www.arm.com/developer/learn) offer a consice end-to-end tutorial to achieve a specific outcome. These are supported by [tool quick-start guides](https://www.arm.com/developer/learn/tool-install) to go from 0 to 'hello world' for key Arm ecosystem tools.

## What is a learning path?
A learning path is...
- A consice end-to-end tutorial with steps to enable developers to complete a specific task.
- Always technical, relevant, and up-to-date.
- Simple for anyone to create to through a GitHub-based contribution process.

A learning path is NEVER...
- Documentation, downloads, or the golden source of truth for a product.
- A marketing device or short-lived content/news

## Where do learning paths live?
GitHub. The content is written in markdown and is rendered into a website via Hugo.

## Who can write a learning path?
Anyone, yourself included!

## How can I write a learning path?
Visit the GitHub repository and follow the straightforward steps described in the readme. 

## When will a learning path be reviewed and published?
The contribution process follows this flow:
1. Finish writing your learning path and submit a pull request (more details on this are found in the GitHub readme). 
2. The Arm Learning Path team will quickly review your content to ensure it has the appropriate meta-data and is formatted consistently with other Learning Paths (read this Learning Path for details on how to get this correct right away).
3. Your contribution will then be published!

Note: If there are small typos or formatting issues, we will fix them before publishing. This is done to reduce the amount of back-and-forth overhead on small issues; you will always be able to view all changes through GitHub and let us know if you object to any changes.

Note: If there are large factual / reproducibility errors in your contribution, we will contact you to resolve them before publishing.
