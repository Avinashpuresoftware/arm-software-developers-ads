## Find Arm Hardware 

Desktop and laptop hardware, based on Arm processors, is available with different operating systems including Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS. 

[Windows Dev Kit 2023](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-dev-kit-2023/94k0p67w7581) is for software developers creating Windows applications for Arm.

Windows on Arm laptops can also be used for software development. 

- [Lenovo ThinkPad X13s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx/thinkpad-x13s-(13-inch-snapdragon)/len101t0019)
- [Surface Pro 9 with 5G](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-pro-9/93vkd8np4fvk)

Chromebooks with Arm processors can also be used for software development. A recent 2-in-1 with good performance is the [Acer Spin 513](https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-spin-513-cp513-2h/pdp/NX.K0LAA.001).

Both Windows and Chrome OS have a Linux subsystem which can be used for software development tasks. 

Some single board computers have enough performance to serve as desktop computers. A good example is the [Khadas Edge2](https://www.khadas.com/edge2). 

The [Honeycomb LX2 workstation](https://www.solid-run.com/arm-servers-networking-platforms/honeycomb-servers-workstation/#honeycomb-workstation) is another example of an Arm computer built for developers.
