## Install the required packages

* i3 needs a few packages installed to operate. If prompted for a selection on these or any following pacman installs just press enter to select the default
```cmd
pacman -Sy xorg xorg-xinit dmenu
``` 

* It also needs a ttf font installed to display correctly. I chose ttf-liberation and it worked for me, but this is user preference
```cmd
sudo pacman -Sy ttf-liberation
```

* Install a terminal emulator. I went with Alacritty for its speed, but this is a user choice
```cmd
sudo pacman -Sy alacritty
```

## Install i3 and initial configuration

* Install
```cmd
sudo pacman -Sy i3
```

* Edit xinitrc to allow a command to start i3 and the Xorg display server
```cmd
echo "exec i3" >> ~/.xinitrc
```

* Start i3
```cmd
startx
```

* Upon starting for the first time it will prompt you if you want to generate a config file. Just press enter to generate

* It will then ask you what you want your modifier key to be. This is the key you will hold to be able to control the i3 manager. Entirely user preference, I went with the Win key as some applications make use of Alt

## First use

* Your screen will be blank. Press \<modifier> + Enter to bring up a terminal emulator. Doing so twice will split the screen. 

* \<modifier> + d will bring a text selector at the top of the screen where you can start typing to select any installed software to open.

* Read the user's guide to learn how much i3 can do: https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html
