## Find Arm Hardware 

Embedded hardware, based on Arm Cortex-A and Cortex-R processors, is available from various Arm partners. 

Arm development boards for embedded projects may also be referred to as edge computing boards or as single board computers (SBCs). Embedded projects often use Linux as an operating system.

Please add your favorite board sources to the list.

[96boards](https://www.96boards.org/) provides information about development boards used across a variety of application types. 

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) provides a range of boards based on Arm Cortex-A and Cortex-M processors. The Raspberry Pi 4 is popular for Linux projects. 

[NVIDIA Jetson Developer Kits](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-developer-kits) are good for AI projects.

[NXP i.MX](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors:IMX_HOME) boards are used in a variety of applications.

Alternatives to the Raspberry Pi are also available, such as the [Khadas Edge2](https://www.khadas.com/edge2), the [Orange Pi 5](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5.html) and the [Rock5](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5) SBC. 

Cortex-R development boards are less common, but are available with devices from Texas Instruments and Renesas.
