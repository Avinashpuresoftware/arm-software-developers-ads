title: "Build and run Matter examples with AVH 3rd Party platforms"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Learn how to build reference Matter examples and run on Arm Virtual Hardware.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 60
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    Learning path for embedded software developers new to Arm Virtual Hardware to get familiar with main features.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Instantiate Arm Virtual Hardware instances
    - Build and run Matter examples on Arm Virtual Hardware
    - Demonstrate communication between two virtual hardware targets
    - Use GitHub Actions to manage ongoing development in a CI/CD workflow
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with embedded programing is assumed
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
