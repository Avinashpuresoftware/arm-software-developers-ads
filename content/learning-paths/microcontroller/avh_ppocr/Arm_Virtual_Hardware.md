# Arm Virtual Hardware
[Arm Virtual Hardware](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware) (AVH) scales and accelerates IoT software development by virtualising popular IoT development kits, Arm-based processors, and systems in the cloud. It is an evolution of Arm’s modelling technology that removes the wait for hardware and the complexity of building and configuring board farms for testing. It enables modern agile software development practices, such as DevOps and MLOps workflows.

Currently, Arm Virtual Hardware is available for [Corstone](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-subsystems) platforms and [Cortex](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu) processors via an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-urbpq7yo5va7g) as well for third-party hardware available via [Arm’s SaaS](https://avh.arm.com/) platform. For this example, we use Arm Virtual Hardware with Corstone platforms and Cortex processors via AWS. Refer to this [document](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/examples/html/MicroSpeech.html#autotoc_md5) to learn how to access and launch AVH AMI instance. In addition, Arm is working with many SaaS developer tool and platform providers to integrate AVH directly into workflows developers are already using today.
