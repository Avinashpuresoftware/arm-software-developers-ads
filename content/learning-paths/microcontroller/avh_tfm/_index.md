title: "Get started with Trusted Firmware-M"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Build TF-M tests and run on Arm Virtual Hardware.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 15
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    Embedded software developers new to Trusted Firmware-M.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Build and run the reference TF-M tests.
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with embedded C programming
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
