title: "Investigate example Virtual Peripheral implementation"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Explore an example Python implementation of a Virtual Peripheral with Arm Virtual Hardware and Virtual IO.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 15
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    Embedded software developers new to Arm Virtual Hardware to get familiar with main features.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Create and integrate an LED peripheral with the Virtual IO (VIO) interface of AVH.
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with Python
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
