title: "Build and run your first embedded image"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Learn how to write, compile, and run a simple embedded system program.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 30   
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    Learning path for embedded software developers new to Arm Compiler for Embedded.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Create and build an example project
    - Run example on Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP)
    - Understand boot code and other syntax
    - Extend example to use different I/O mechanisms
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.
