title: "Get started with Raspberry Pi Pico"
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Setup tools and start programming with Raspberry Pi Pico.
# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 45
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    Embedded software developers new to Raspberry Pi Pico
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Install the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
    - Run a hello world example
    - Measure application performance
    - Debug applications
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Familiar with microcontroller C programming
    - Comfortable with the Linux terminal 
    - Raspberry Pi Pico board
    - Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 400 or other Linux computer running Ubuntu
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
