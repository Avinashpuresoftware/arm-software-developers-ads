[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is a mature cloud computing platform. An overview of their services is described [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/).

As with most cloud service providers, Azure offers a pay-as-you-use [pricing policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/), including a number of [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) services.

This guide is to help you get started with [Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/), using Arm-based [Ampere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-virtual-machines-with-ampere-altra-arm-based-processors-generally-available/) processors. This is a general purpose compute platform, essentially your own personal computer in the cloud.

Full [documentation and quickstart guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) are available.

## Create an account and log in

Creating a personal account is straight forward. Click on `Free account` or `Try Azure for free` on the [Azure homepage](https://azure.microsoft.com), and follow the on-screen instructions to log in, else register as a new user. You can use an existing Microsoft account if you have one.

If using an organization's account, you will likely need to consult with your internal administrator.

Once logged in, you will be presented with the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create your Virtual Machine (VM) instance

Locate [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines) from the list of `Azure Services`, then click `Create` > `Azure virtual machine`.

You will be presented with the `Create a virtual machine` dialog.

## Project details

This section is used to separate instances, usually for internal budgeting or access permissions. If a `Resource group` to contain your VMs does not yet exist, click on `Create new`. If you do not create a group, a new one will automatically be created based on your first VM name.

## Instance details

This section defines the virtual machine to be created.

### Virtual machine name

Give your VM a meaningful name. This is especially useful if you intend to create multiple VMs.

### Region

This is the location of the server where your VM will reside. While it is generally recommended to select a region closest to your location, not all regions may support Arm-based servers. You may need to change region to get access to such a server.

### Availability options / Security type

This are reliability and security setting. See the documentation for details. This can generally be left as default.

### Image

This is the operating system that will run on your VM. Select the appropriate one from the pull down. Some will have additional pricing associated with them. Not all are available for Arm VMs. To filter, click on `See all images`, and then select `Arm64` from the `Image Type` filter. You can then select a particular version of your preferred OS from the `Select` pulldown of that OS tab.

Note that if a `Windows` operating system is selected, the user must have an appropriate license. See the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment) for information.

### VM architecture

If not enabled automatically based on the above image, select `Arm64` for an Arm-based operating system. This will update the `Size` pulldown (see below) to present Arm based servers.

### Run with Azure Spot discount

This is a low cost pricing option. See Azure documentation for details. This does not affect the deployment of the virtual machine.

### Size

Select an appropriate [size](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) for your compute needs from the pull down.

## Administrator account

This section defines how users [connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux-vm-connect) to the VM instance.

### Authentication type (Linux systems)

 `SSH public key` is the most common and recommended choice.

 ### Username

 Create an appropriate user name (default is `azureuser`). Windows VMs will also require a password to be set.

 ### SSH public key resource / Key pair name (Linux systems)

 Use an existing key pair or generate a new one, as defined by `Key pair name`. If `Generate new key pair` is selected, your private key will be generated during the [Create](#create-instance) step.

## Inbound port rules

These settings can be used to limit access to your VM. See the documentation for more info. This can generally be left as default. Linux systems will be connected to by SSH. Windows by Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Licensing (Windows only)

Tick the box to confirm you have an appropriate license to deploy a Windows virtual machine. See the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment) for information.

## Other settings

There are other tabs defining many advanced settings. See the documentation for full detail. They can generally be left as default.

## Create instance

When the VM settings are to your liking, click on `Review + create`. Your settings will be validated by Azure. If valid, click on `Create` to create your VM instance.

After a short time, the VM will be created. Click on `Go to resource` to see various parameters, notably the `Public IP address`.

## Connect to your VM instance (Linux)

These instructions are for Linux-based virtual machines. If using a Windows-based virtual machine, please jump to [here](#windows).

You can connect to the instance with your preferred SSH client. For example if using default `azureuser` username:
```console
ssh -i <private_key> azureuser@<public_ip_address>
```
You will also see this command under the `Connect` > `SSH` tab.

Terminal applications such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and similar can be used.

### Explore your instance

Use the [uname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname) utility to verify that you are using an Arm-based server. For example:
```console
uname -m
```
will identify the host machine as `aarch64`.

You are now ready to get started with the [Server and Cloud learning paths](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/).

## Connect to your VM instance (Windows) {#windows}

On your local host PC, launch the `Remote Desktop Connection` application.

Enter the `Public IP Address` of the Windows VM as the `Computer` to be connected to. Username can also be specified.

You will be prompted for the user password (set earlier), and you will connect. You can interact with the VM in the same way as you would a local desktop.

### Explore your instance

Open `Control Panel` > `System`, and verify that `Device` > `System Type` identifies as an ARM-based processor.

You are now ready to get started with the [Server and Cloud learning paths](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/).
