## Find Arm Hardware 

Server hardware, based on Arm Neoverse processors, is available from cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors. 

Creating an account with a cloud service provider (CSPs) is the easiest way to get started with Arm. CSPs offer introductory free credits to start learning cloud services. A pay-as-you-go model makes it easy to try out Arm hardware at no cost. 

Software developers often try Arm hardware as a way to reduce cost and improve application performance.

Major cloud providers offer Arm instances based on Neoverse processors. 
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/)
- [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/arm/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-virtual-machines-with-ampere-altra-arm-based-processors-generally-available/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/arm-on-compute)


Free tier offers are currently available.
- [Amazon EC2 t4g.small instances powered by AWS Graviton2 processors are free until Dec 31st 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t4/)
- [Oracle free tier includes up to 4 instances of ARM Ampere A1 Compute which are always free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)
- [Until April 5, 2023 Tau T2A VMs in Google Cloud are available for a free trial](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-arm-vm-instance#t2afreetrial)


Hardware vendors also offer Arm servers for purchase. 

- [GIGABYTE](https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Enterprise/ARM-Server)
- [Avantek](https://store.avantek.co.uk/arm-servers.html)

More developer hardware options are available from the [Works on Arm initiative](https://www.arm.com/markets/computing-infrastructure/works-on-arm). 

Servers typically run the Linux operating system. Popular distributions for servers include Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE Linux, Debian, Amazon Linux, and Oracle Linux.
